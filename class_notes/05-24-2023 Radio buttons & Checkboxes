 -- WAITS RECAP --
 - Implicit wait
 Prevents program to throw NoSuchElementException. It tries every 0.5 seconds. It is also called global wait.
 	NOTE: NoSuchElementException = If element we want to find is not existing in the DOM, the program will throw an
 	exception.

 - Explicit wait
 	Explicit more like for specific condition. It will wait up to certain amount of time for the specific condition
 	that we defined.
 	Ex; Element to be visible, element to be clickable, attribute to be etc.
 	It tries for that specific condition every 0.5 seconds, and when the condition is met, it wont wait for the timeout
 	and it executes the action.

 - Fluent wait
 	It works as same as Explicit wait, only difference is we can set the iteration time.
