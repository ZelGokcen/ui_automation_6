Computer: input-process-output
software + hardware

hardware: parts - physical devices
software: programs, os etc.

software -> soul
hardware -> skeleton


Software: is a set of instruction to use computers.


Software is what we have in out pockets - phones, machines.
System software -> Operating systems: MACOS, WINDOWS, Android, IOS
Application software -> Target, Walmart, Amazon
						Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp
						Chase, BOFA, USBank
						Candy Crush, Texas Holdem
						YouTube, NetFlix, Spotify
						Gmail, Google Maps
						Office


Life need -> IDEA -> SDLC -> Product (software)

Steak holders


Product Owner
- technical or non-technical
- Prepares the requirements (acceptance criteria)
- Creates EPICs, User stories, acceptance criteria



System Architects - Designer
- Backend development, frontend development, testing tools, deployments,
- What DB, tools, languages


Designers
- Design the pages etc.


Developers
- Backend Developers: API, DB 	-> Java, .Net, Phyton, Go, Ruby...
- Frontend Developers: UI 		-> Javascript, HTML, CSS

Backend Developers: Java spring-boot framework
Frontend Developers: JS React, Angular, Vue


Framework: tools, design patterns, rules that you use to create backend, frontend or testing structures.

A framework uses a programming language with set of tools designed around it


EXAMPLE: Java, Maven, TestNG, WebDriverManager, Selenium WebDriver
		 Singleton design pattern, OOP Principles




Does usually backend or frontend starts first?
- it does not depend!
- both can be BUT!
- MOST of the time, backend goes first




Testers
- Manual testers : human efforts
- Automation testers : code to simulate human actions

ADVANTAGES of AUTOMATION:
- eliminates human errors
- time and cost saving
- reliable and more accurate
- reusable and repetitive
- increased test coverage
- less resource
- reports - faster to get reports
- parallel execution
- debugging - logs


DISADVANTAGES of AUTOMATION
- initial costs
- may not always mimic the real user actions
- refactoring - maintanence
- cannot automate everything - restrictions
- styles, alignments, positions
- no random test

Selenium:
- it is a testing tool
- it is used for web app automation
- it can be used with multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
- it can be used with multiple programming languages
- it consist of multiple components
	Selenium IDE
	Selenium RC
	Selenium WebDriver
	Selenium Grid
- it provides libraries to automate user actions - interact with web elements
- it can be used with operating systems such as macOS, Windows
- it can be used for parallel testing
- open source
- HUGE COMMUNITY


-Selenese is the language used by Selenium IDE


SELENIUM COMPONENTS
Selenium IDE: is not preferred!
Selenium RC (Remote Control): was merged with Selenium WebDriver
Selenium WebDriver: automates tests
Selenium Grid: allows parallel execution




SELENIUM ADVANTAGES:
-open source and there is a huge community support
-supports multiple programming languages: Java, JS, C#, etc.
-supports multiple operating systems (cross-platform): Mac, Windows
-supports multiple browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari
-supports parallel testing
-easy to learn and implement


SELENIUM DISADVANTAGES:
-Slow compared to Cypress and Playwright
-Waits - synchronization
-Supports only web-based application
-Cannot automate Capthcas, barcodes, graphics, maps, images
-Reports


ALTERNATIVES
-Similar: WebDriverIO
-NEW tools: Cypress, Playwright


WHY SELENIUM IS IN USE?
-Switch is not easy
-HUGE COMMUNITY
